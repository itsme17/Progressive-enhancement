        <h3>Preamble</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>read this once</li>
            <li>then read it again</li>
            <li>then tell it to your best friend</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The story</h3>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q>Maybe.</q>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events.
                You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q>Maybe.</q>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q>Maybe.</q>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
            Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q>Maybe.</q>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
