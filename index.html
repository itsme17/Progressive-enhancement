        <h3>The story</h3>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said, <i class="neighbour"><q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q></i> The farmer said, <i class="farmer"><q>Maybe.</q></i>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<i class="neighbour"><q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events.
                You now have eight horses!</q></i>  The farmer again said, <i class="farmer"><q>Maybe.</q></i>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said, <i class="neighbour"><q>Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,</q></i> and the farmer responded, <i class="farmer"><q>Maybe.</q></i>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
            Again all the neighbors came around and said, <i class="neighbour"><q>Isn’t that great!</q></i> Again, he said, <i class="farmer"><q>Maybe.</q></i>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em class="good">good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
